/**
 * Replaces e2e/tests/features/pages.feature — the build gate.
 *
 * Signed in, every static route must render without an HTTP error, a failed or
 * 5xx app API call, an uncaught exception, or a console error. Routes are read
 * from the generated route tree, so a page added today is swept today; nothing
 * here lists them.
 *
 * This is mutationless on purpose — it signs in and navigates, nothing more —
 * which is what makes it safe to run against the live dev server on every
 * build. Behaviour scenarios that create, edit or delete belong in their own
 * feature, untagged `smoke`, so the fast gate stays fast and deterministic.
 *
 * It sweeps as `actors.priya`, the primary persona — an attendee. That is the right
 * actor for this app: nothing here is behind a session, so a page that renders for
 * Priya renders for the room. It must name her literally, because PKU677 requires a
 * browser step's actor to be a literal `actors.<name>`.
